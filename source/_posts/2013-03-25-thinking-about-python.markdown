A few weeks ago, I cracked open [Think Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025696.do), and so far it's been a fun ride.

The interactive nature of the book has helped reinforce the various language quirks for me, and while the language so far may not be that much of a challenge (due in part to its similarities with Groovy/Ruby), the algorythms in each chapter have kept me going. I'm even considering trying to show my daughter TurtleWorld.

Oreilly's Head First books come close in terms of readability, but even after putting away three or four so far, I'd still say that Think Python's got the edge.

If you're new to programming, this is a great place to start, particularly if you can snag the e-book during a half-off sale.
