    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At a previous position, I was a big fan of using the Maven Jetty Plugin to develop web apps, particularly when I was working on JSPs that needed some tweaking for different browsers. The main drawback to this approach was that using the plugin for multiple applications was cumbersome and the documentation (at the time) wasn't that great.</p>

<p>For the last few months, I've been doing all of my development through Intellij and Tomcat using a Run/Debug configuration for the app, and I didn't hit a snag, until yesterday.</p>

<p>One of the big perks of using the Run/Debug configuration is the availability of the "Reload classes and resources" function when you make a change. Selecting this option gets you near-Jetty speed when you want to make changes to classes or JSPs and see those changes reflected immediately. There are a few caviats though. You will still need to restart the container if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>change a method signature</li>
<li>add a class</li>
<li>rename a class</li>
<li>change your Spring context</li>
</ul>


<p>However, if you are changing the inner workings of a method or altering a JSP, a class/resource reload will reflect your change almost instantly.</p>

<p>The important gotcha that I found today, is that this option is only available if all the applications running your container are running exploded, which isn't a big deal if you only run one app, but when you run 7 it can be an issue. If any of your apps aren't exploded, you will see a different option, "Hot Swap", which, from what I can tell, is about the same as a complete restart from a performance perspective.</p>

<p>I made the mistake of selecting one of my wars, rather than the exploded version of the war, and got bit until I double checked my app configuration. Hope this saves you some pain.</p>

    <updated>2013-04-23T18:17:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://benkiefer.github.com/blog/2013/04/23/powermockito-constructor-mocking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mockito provides mechanisms for mocking most of the stuff you need, but remains mysteriously silent on constructor mocking. "Newing up" an object when you are mocking in your unit tests is a pain, and I often found myself writing tiny factories to isolate where I was using a constructor.</p>

<p>For example, to test the following code...</p>

<p>```
public class Helper {</p>

<pre><code>public void doSomething(String arg){
    new Something(arg).doSomething();
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>You might end up writing something like this to make it more testable...</p>

<p>```
public class Helper {</p>

<pre><code>private SomethingFactory somethingFactory;

public void doSomething(String arg) {
    Something something = somethingFactory().build(arg);
    something.doit();
}

public void setSomethingFactory(SomethingFactory somethingFactory) {
    this.somethingFactory = somethingFactory;
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Now you can inject a mock SomethingFactory in your test, and all the real SomethingFactory does is create your object with the appropriate arg and return it.</p>

<p>PowerMockito offers an enhancement to the Mockito API that let's you sidestep this problem with its "whenNew" method, but their documentation is lacking.</p>

<p>To use, "whenNew", you will need to supplement your typical Mockito test with a few enhancements.</p>

<p>```
@RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)
@PrepareForTest(Helper.class)
public class HelperTest {</p>

<pre><code>@Mock
private Something mockSomething;

@InjectMocks
private Helper helper;

@Test
public void doSomething() throws Exception {
    String argument = "arg";

    PowerMockito.whenNew(Something.class).withArguments(argument).thenReturn(mockSomething);

    helper.doSomething(argument);

    verify(mockSomething).doIt();
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The important changes over a typical Mockito test are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The use of the PowerMockRunner in our JUnit @RunWith annotation</li>
<li>The use of the @PrepareForTest method where we specify the name of the class we are testing (Helper.class in this case).</li>
<li>The "throws Exception" on our method signature caused by the usage of "whenNew"</li>
<li>The static invocation of the "whenNew" method, and our passing in the "argument" parameter".</li>
</ul>


<p>With these changes, you can roll back to the previous code, getting rid of your unnecessary factory and getting rid of some of the clutter from our Helper java class.</p>
